Have you played Wordle and become enraged at the American spelling of a word?

Now you can play Worldle and lose the will to live thinking of the name of North American cities!

Worldle is a city based word game! Use the interactive map and test your geography as you guess the name of a random city. Guess the city on every continent and then come back tomorrow to do it all over again.

Wordle was created by Dave Taylor (https://github.com/Daveoxys) and me!

React World Map used from GitHub repo (https://github.com/heatherbooker/react-world-map#readme)
